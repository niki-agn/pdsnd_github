# **Exploring US Bikeshare Data by Using Statistics**
***

## **Overview**
### _Description of my project_
With the help of Python I have explored data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
### _Specific areas covered by the project_
The following descriptive statistics were computed by using data of bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington:
1.  **Popular times of travel**
    + most common month
    - most common day of week
    - most common hour of day
1.  **Popular stations and trip**
    + most common start station
    - most common end station
    + most frequent combination of start station and end station trip
1.  **Trip duration**
    + total travel time
    - average travel time
1.  **User info**
    + counts of each user type
    - counts of each gender (it was only available for NYC and Chicago)
    - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (it was only available for NYC and Chicago)

My script prompts users if they want to see **_5 lines of raw data_**. It continues iterating these prompts and displaying the next 5 lines of raw data at each iteration. The program stops when users say 'no' or there is no more raw data to display.

## **Files used**
The following files of data were used during the project:
- chicago.csv
+ new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

## **Software used**
The following software were applied:
- Python 3 (NumPy, and pandas were installed using Anaconda)
+ PyCharm
* Project Workspace to complete and submit my project by Udacity
